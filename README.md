The application also calculates the **monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)** and provides clear feedback on approval or rejection reasons, simulating **real-world banking decision-making processes**.

This project helps in understanding **Python GUI development**, **user input handling**, and **basic financial calculations**.
